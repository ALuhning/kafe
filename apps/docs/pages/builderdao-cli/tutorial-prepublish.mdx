## Pre-publish

The prepublish workflow deals with the builderdao-config.service to generate the
builderdao config and lock files, also updating the hash digest of the tutorial folder.

## Prerequisites

- You must have setup the builderdao CLI.
- You must be either in the root of the tutorial folder or in a subfolder of the tutorial folder. `/tutorials/<tutorial-name>`

## Basic usage

```
Usage: builderdao tutorial prepublish [options] [learnPackageName]

Perform pre-publishing tasks

Arguments:
  learnPackageName     Tutorial slug for complete tutorial package

Options:
  --force              Force Rewrite the lock file base on slug (default: false)
  --seed <seed>        Ceramic Seed (env: CERAMIC_SEED)
  --nodeUrl <nodeUrl>  Ceramic Node Url (env: CERAMIC_NODE_URL)
  -h, --help           Display help for command

## What it does ?

Keeps the builderdao config and lock files up to date base on the tutorial slug. BuilderDAO CLI makes a request to solana & Ceramic to get metadata about the tutorial.

- Using Solana Client to get coresponding metadata from the tutorial.
- Using Ceramic Client to get metadata from the tutorial.
- Update reviewer and author information in the builderdao config file.
- Update the hash digest of the tutorial folder. This allow us to check if the tutorial files has been modified or not.
