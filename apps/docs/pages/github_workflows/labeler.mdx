# GitHub Workflows - labeler

We are using [actions/labeler@v4](https://github.com/actions/labeler) from Github to identify the labels for the pull request. The labeler is a simple tool that allows you to label a pull request with a coresponding label base on the content of the pull request.

Defination of the labels is defineted in the [labeler.yml](../../../.github/labeler.yml) file.

```yaml
dao-program:
  - dao-programs/*
  - dao-programs/**/*

frontend:
  - any: ['apps/web/**/*']

tutorial:
  - any: ['tutorials/**/*']

docs:
  - any: ['apps/docs/**/*']
```
